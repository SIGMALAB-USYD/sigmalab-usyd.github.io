Our lab are always recruiting **M.Phil. or Ph.D.** students with strong academic background and/or solid programming skill. Before you apply, please first read the [**Application Guideline for SIGMA Lab**](/guidelines/guideline_eng.pdf). For Chinese students, please refer to [**SIGMA Lab招生简章**](/guidelines/ad.pdf) and [**SIGMA Lab申请须知**](/guidelines/guideline_chinese.pdf) and [**关于悉尼大学奖学金申请**](/guidelines/scholarship_chi.pdf). You can send an email to [**sigma.usyd[at]gmail.com**](mailto:sigma.usyd@gmail.com) after you have read the guidelines carefully.

Currently, we have no position for postdoc researchers and research assistants for our lab.
