This is the homepage of the SIGMA Lab at the University of Sydney. We built this website ourselves in 2017 with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). 

Our website is user-friendly, highly modularized and could be personalized very quickly! If you'd like to, you can build your own academic website for free based on our framework. The code of our website is available on [Github](https://github.com/SIGMALAB-USYD/sigmalab-usyd.github.io). For commercial use, please contact [Prof. Ouyang](https://wlouyang.github.io/) for details.
